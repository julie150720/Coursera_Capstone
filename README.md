## PROJECT MOTIVATION 

In this project, we will use Foursquare API to analyze different neighborhoods and find a good
location to open a bubble tea business. With major bubble tea franchises such as GongCha,
Kungfu tea,... it is inevitable that there is a growing demand for this beverage.

1. Which area has the most condensed asian restaurant?
2. Among the most condensed asian restaurant, which one has fewer bubble tea stores?
3. Which area is best suitable for opening a bubble tea store?

We look for alocation which is closer to a lot of asian restaurants, but also the neighborhood should not be
crowded with bubble tea shops to avoid competition.

Greater Boston Area was chosen in this project due to the following reasons:
- Sixteen cities and towns in Greater Boston in 2016 had at least 4,000 Asian Americans.
Many asian american are still living close to the suburban Greater Boston Area.
- Massachusetts is a destination for international students, in which China and India were
the leading countries of origin for international students. Therefore, there is an
ever-growing demand for asian restaurants.

Obviously, this project would be useful for investors who are interested in opening a bubble tea
shop, or asian coffee shop, or even a particular asian restaurant such as vietnamese restaurant,
thai restaurant, etc. Not only so, international students or travellers will be interested in this
analysis if they want to find a neighborhood full of asian food.
